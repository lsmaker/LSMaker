# LSMaker
This is the source code of the basic LSMaker Arduino software.

## Clone

**Using SSH**

## Methods

- `void init(void)`:

**Description**: This procedure performs the basic initializations needed by the LSMaker Arduino platform. It is important that this method is **ALWAYS** called at the very beginning of your project's `void setup()` procedure.

- `bool addModule(LSMakerModule *module, unsigned long period = 0)`: 

**Description**: This method subscribes the LSMakerModule instance received to the LSMaker system scheduler. If no period value is provided the LSMaker scheduler will call the module's *execute()* module as soon as possible (62.5us). Otherwise, if period value is provided (in microseconds), the LSMaker scheduler will call the *execute()* method when the elapsed time since the last call to the module's *execute()* method is bigger or equals than the period value.

**Return value**: True is returned if the module has been successfully subscribed to the LSMaker scheduler. Otherwise, false is returned.

- `bool removeModule(LSMakerModule *module)`:

**Description**: This method checks if the LSMakerModule instance received is currently attached to LSMaker scheduler. If so, the instance is removed. Otherwise, no operation is performed.

**Return value**: True is returned if the moudle has been successfully removed from the LSMaker scheduler. Otherwise, false is returned.

## Classes

- `LinkedList<T>`: This class implements a generic list that can hold any kind of data on its nodes.
```
template <class T> class LinkedList{

  public:

    //Constructors & Destructors
    LinkedList(void);

    //Add, Get & Remove interface
    void addElement(T element);
    T getElement(void);
    bool removeElement(void);

    //Iteration interface
    void moveFirst(void);
    void moveNext(void);
    bool hasNext(void);

};

```
